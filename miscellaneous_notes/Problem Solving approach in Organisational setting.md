# Problem Solving approach in Organisational setting

	C.D.C.I.P.
	1.  Understand (my) Circle of Competence. **C**
	2.  Define the problem (with others CoC if necessary) **D**
	3.  Timeframe & Chunking. **C**
	4.  Gathering info > Immersion > Perspective **I**
	5.  Prototype > reflect > repeat. **P**
	

> "The formulation of a problem is often more essential than its solution,"
> "To raise new questions, new possibilities, to regard old problems from a new angle, requires creative imagination and marks real advances in science."
> *- Albert Einstein*

## Problem definition
Once Causual structures are identified with [[BOOK Summary - The Great Mental Models Vol 1 & 2#First-Principles Thinking|First Princinples Thinking]], Experts in the range of solution methods will select them appropriately.
## Timeframe & Size tradeoff
comes second: **chunk the problem** so a valuable piece of it can fit in the timeframe allocated.

## Immersion
- Be in the problem Context. 
- Ask stakeholders what they think problem is.
- Data /Information Provenence: [[BOOK Summary - The Great Mental Models Vol 1 & 2#The Map is not the Territory|The Map is not the Territory]]
- Get familiar with the boundaries of my own knowledge ([[BOOK Summary - The Great Mental Models Vol 1 & 2#Aquiring Wisdom|Circles of Competence]]).

## Perspective
> - "blue dot in a white room"
> - "flipping between content - context" -Andrew Mckenzie, meeting near Best Practice 2020
- Ball on a boat analogy: 2 imperfect perspectives > 1
## Gathering information

## Analogy to Convex Optimsation Math *(analogy in progress..)*

The proactive Data Scientist's job is to wrap a convex optimisation problem around what they're hearing from people in thew organisaion.
- Company: We want to minimise this objective function (churn). 
- D.S.: but if we set up the problem like this, we can call the two problems "***equivalent but not identical***":[***1***](https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/1538624/equivalent-formulation-of-linear-discrimination-problem-on-boyd-convex-optimizat) or [***2***](https://web.stanford.edu/class/ee364a/lectures/problems.pdf): maximise new customers faster than maximising customer loss")
- in the 'subject to' section, we're not sure if this variable is having an impact or not... S: so fiorst we run a different convex optimisation problem around liklihood.
	- Now, we can call the variable a random variable, in the converx optimisation problem (constrainied to Ax = b where b ~N(0,1))
- want to talk about imapcts business? lets set up a loss function to minimise such that, if were wrong by 1 or 2, no loss, then its linear (hinge loss)
